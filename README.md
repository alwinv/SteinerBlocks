How to use Steiner Blocks HoloLens app
When you start the app, it will show you a brief introduction to the blocks concept and then you will be able to create your own, or look at some of the patterns created by Curtis Steiner before you start.
To create your own, the process is this:
1.	Select a block
2.	Rotate it
3.	Put it back

## 1. Select a block:
First, focus your attention on the block you want to select:
- Stand in front of the set of blocks and look straight at them
- As you move your head, you’ll notice 4 white arrowheads around the block that the app thinks you’re looking at

### Use verbal commands:
- Say: “Select”
- Say: “Select Row”, “Select Column” or “Select All” to have rotations apply to multiple blocks at once

### Use HoloLens gestures:
- Air-tap

Once you select the block, it will pop out towards you, out of the block grid and you can begin rotating it.

## 2. Rotate the selected block:
### Use verbal commands: 
Say one of these directions to rotate the block in that direction: 
- Say: “Left”
- Say: “Right”
- Say: “Up”
- Say: “Down”
- Say: “Turn” (clockwise)
- Say: “Flip” (180)

### Use HoloLens gestures: Pinch + hold, then move your hand:
- up-down
- left-right
- forwards-backwards

# Privacy Policy
